# FREEDIVING
{: .clear-images-h2.align-to-center}

Freediving is my healing practice. In order for you to better understand why I must take you along my journey of how I got introduced to this beautiful sport.&nbsp;

I’ve always been drawn to the ocean and what lies beneath the surface. The problem was, I didn’t live in a place where the ocean was near. As a kid, my best memories were spent in my own backyard underwater of a swimming pool. I would pretend to be a mermaid hiding out in my cove, which was really just the stairs to enter the pool. Swimming the length of the pool on one breath countless times, competing with my brother. I didn’t know at the time, that I was practicing dynamic apnea. I’m aware of how long this story would be if I started with my childhood so let’s fast forward.&nbsp;

In my early twenties I started exploring the underwater world during my travels to Thailand, South Africa, Mexico, Panama, Spain, and Barbados. Each experience drawing me in closer to its majesty. Watching the wisest of turtles venture through their life long journey. Swimming alongside hundreds of whale sharks. Dancing with jellyfish. Snorkelling through ship wrecks. One of the most impactful experiences was cage diving with great white sharks. We got to understand these mysterious creatures with every second we could hold our breath underwater. At the time, I had no experience doing this. The longer we held our breath the higher the chance of being graced by a white shark (more accurately termed) slowly swimming by. It’s when I learned that they are not always ferocious animals, but deeply misunderstood.&nbsp;

Wanting to learn more, I needed the ocean to be more accessible to me so, in another life, I was working as a flight attendant. Exploring everything the world has to offer while getting paid to do so. Excited about a life filled with travel and new experiences I attended a private pilot school. I know what you might be thinking, if you wanted to be closer to the ocean, why would you choose a life in the sky? The furthest possible job from the ocean.&nbsp;

Well, life has an interesting way of putting you back on the right path. In October 2018 I felt a pain in my chest that can easily be mistaken for sore muscle. My doctor notified me that I had a pneumothorax. I’ll save you the google search and give you a brief description of what this means. Pneumothorax is another word for collapsed lung. This means that I had a tiny tear in my thorax that leaked air into the space between my lung and chest wall. What this really meant is that I couldn’t fly anymore. I would be like a punctured raft floating through the ocean. I needed to be patched up. Unless I had a surgery, I could not return to work.&nbsp;

Going through an inner struggle I found myself applying for a shark conservation trip called Project Hiu. I ended up in Lombok, Indonesia, known for its lush scenery, sort of like an “untouched Bali”. Also, infamously known for its shark fishermen village. I found myself amidst a group of free diving ocean guardians. I watched in awe from the surface as they dived to depths placing pottery to build homes for octopus. Surrounded by talented underwater photographers that worked with athletes aka freedivers I began to feel inspired.&nbsp;

Although I ended up getting the surgery, I felt like my path instantly changed. I felt like my world had been turned upside down. Thing is, my world was in the sky, and if I turned that upside down, I’m in the sea, exactly where I need to be. I used this as a sign to accept life’s offering to slow down.&nbsp;

My injury became the catalyst to my own personal alchemy. My recovery process was focused on deep breathing and striving for strong healthy lungs. I began to meditate daily, using yoga to connect to my breath and stretch out my scar tissue. Eating foods that increased oxygen levels such as cordycep mushrooms, kale, healthy fats like olive oil and avocados. All the things that freediving athletes used as training techniques were things I was already practicing every day. I started to see the full circle, I couldn’t wait to get into the water. Learning that I can never scuba dive again, freediving helped me reinvent my identity. It showed me a different, more weightless way to fly. It became my inspiration to heal myself from the inside, out and I wanted to use it to heal our planet.&nbsp;

Freediving as a sport, is not about competition at all. It’s merely learning to get comfortable with the reaction of your body without air, against pressure depths. I say without air, and not without oxygen because our bodies are actually filled up with enough oxygen to get us through the dive. The hardest part is getting through the feeling of carbon dioxide build up from the moment we begin our breath hold. We experience this as an urge to breath. In competition, there are 8 disciplines that are recognized but for me, I want to use freediving to connect with the thing we want to protect; our ocean. &nbsp;

\*For your safety, whether you want to freedive as a sport, or recreationally, I strongly recommend investing in a course.&nbsp;

In order for people to want to protect something, they need to fall in love with it first. By taking our skills in photography and filmmaking underwater, we can make a difference. Awareness plays a big role in conservation. More often than not, divers are at the frontlines of making acts of love for our oceans. From ocean clean ups, to tackling the lionfish invasion, to planting corals, to tagging sharks for scientific data, keep an eye out as we dive deeper in the world of conservation.&nbsp;
