# LE MAELSTRÖM&nbsp;
{: .align-to-center}

A short lifestyle video ad collaboration between eco-tourism brand Buddha Ventura and [Haven creative studio](http://havencreative.studio/) for [Le Maelström](https://lemaelstrom.ca/en/) eco-luxe and sustainable cabins near Qu&eacute;bec City. Capturing a unique above the clouds glamping experience at an altitude of 550 meters. With dramatic landscapes, solar-powered and gas-heated amenities the cozy breathtaking getaway experience at the Lagöm cabin lives up to its Swedish influence of not too much, not too little but *just enough*.&nbsp;
