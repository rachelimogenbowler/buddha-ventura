# Barbados Ecotourism
{: .clear-images-h2.align-to-center}

Hypnotizing maroon and white stripes, feathery pectoral fins and long spikes. Their beauty is a real site but the problem with this non native fish is that it has a ferocious appetite and no natural predators. (Groupers have been successful at eating lion fish but there aren’t many groupers large enough in size in Barbadian waters). It is still unknown if the lion fish were intentionally or inadvertently released in the sea, but facts support that the lion fish invading the Western Atlantic are descendants of prized aquarium lion fish. These facts caused speculations that retired aquarium owners let their lion fish into the sea instead of killing them. Dumping our unwanted things into the sea can cause more damage than one might think.&nbsp;

They were first seen in Floridian waters in the year 1985 however the spread started to become noticeable in 2000. Lion fish were being spotted along the coastal cities of the USA and Bermuda and by 2008, they reached the northern Caribbean islands and Central America. Their adaptability and long reproductive life gives these fish an incredible advantage to grow in population. Females can release up to 2 million eggs per year. They officially reached the island of Barbados in November 2011. It was no surprise at all since Barbados had been tracking the lion fish invasion to create an action plan for their arrival. They are expected to spread as far as Brazil in the next 5 to 10 years.&nbsp;

They eat an average of 1.4 fish per hour consisting of more than 40 different species, as well as juvenile shrimp and lobster, disrupting the reef ecosystems. They have a bad reputation of deteriorating the fauna before leaving the reef. For an ecosystem to remain healthy every species plays a role. When a lion fish removes the small herbivorous fish from the reef it creates a ripple effect for the rest of the system. The less small fish present on the reef, creates a surplus of macro algae. This prevents new colonies of coral to form. In fact, it destroys the reef’s framework by halting coral growth and increasing coral mortality rates. Without corals, other fish species are at a loss of habitat and sand supplies for beaches become unsustainable.&nbsp;

Tourists are drawn to Barbados for its pristine beaches, swim with the turtles and admire colourful corals. As the lion fish population grows, unhealthy reefs will directly impact the dive tourism sector.&nbsp;

Through awareness, and sustained removal with the active participation from divers and fishers we can prevent negative ecological impacts. Creative ways to eliminate the species can include designated markets for consumers to purchase for home cooked meals. Restaurants can start to introduce this fish as a delicacy. Training chefs and culinary students on how to handle and cook this type of fish can also have a positive impact on the fishing industry. Imagine if lion fish became the new tuna, salmon or cod fish. It would add a variety into what we regularly consume. It’s allowing us to reinvent the way we catch fish. It brings awareness to the fragility of our reefs and can inspire more sustainable fishing methods. Organizing lion fish tournaments is a great competitive way to spread awareness and help the problem at the same time. Bounty incentive for dead lion fish sounds like the best way to get everyone working together. Wouldn’t you love to catch a fish, with the possibility of being granted 5000$ for it, on top of doing good for the reef. It sounds like a good investment for the government since they are at risk of losing money from fisheries, tourism, and our overall wellbeing. Our corals are the lungs of the ocean.&nbsp;

The media is a powerful way to share the facts and stay updated. When collective community effort is strong, the media is able to share positive news. Here at Buddha Ventura we are inspired by positive action towards our environment. We want to support and ensure solutions through projects and video production. &nbsp;

I bet you’re feeling like you want to be one of those divers that remove these unwanted fish. You can book a spearfishing tour with **Johanna** at **Trident Freedivers**. She will take you for a hunt just off the shore to help clean the reef. Lion fish are the best fish to shoot for beginners because they hover in place. Their poisonous spikes give them confidence to be less of a moving target, but don’t worry, Hannah will help you cut them off right after you strike. The smaller ones make for a delicious ceviche and the big ones can be grilled up with a local Bajan marinade. Although the spikes of the fish contain venom, they are perfectly safe to eat.

By giving back to the reef the ocean might grace you with some majestic stingrays dancing around the golden glow of the waters as the sun sets. Although it’s helpful to our oceans to remove the lion fish from the reef, during the spearfishing tour keep your eyes peeled for other tasty fish as this is one of the most sustainable ways to eat fish.&nbsp;

*Disclaimer:&nbsp;*
{: .align-to-center}

<u><strong>DO NOT TOUCH LION FISH.</strong></u>&nbsp;This fish may be safe to eat but it is not recommended to touch as their sting can be painful and cause swelling. Despite these symptoms, the venom is rarely fatal.&nbsp;

If a spine appears stuck in skin, proceed by removing all fragments. Apply a continuous flow of hot water to the wound for 30 minutes. Not so hot as to burn the skin, then seek medical attention.&nbsp;

We hope this blog has inspired a new activity for your next Caribbean vacation. Please think twice before throwing something overboard as we learned about the catastrophic ripple effects that can rapidly occur in our oceans.&nbsp;
